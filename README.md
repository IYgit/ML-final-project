# ML-final-project

**Overview**
The main goal of the final project for the course is to predict which customers of the company may consider switching their service provider (a phenomenon known in marketing as "customer churn").

**Evaluation Format**
The model's predictions for the validation dataset will be evaluated using the "balanced accuracy" metric.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset for model training and research contains 10,000 objects. In total, there are 230 features, of which the first 190 are numerical, and the remaining are categorical. The task is a binary classification where the target variable is labeled as y.

The following files are used in the work:

final_proj_data.csv - training dataset

final_proj_test.csv - validation dataset
